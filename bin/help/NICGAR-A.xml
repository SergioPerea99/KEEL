		<type>Association Rules Mining by means of Genetic Algorithms</type>

		<objective>The niching genetic algorithms mines a diverse and reduced set of positive and negative quatitative association rules that are easy to understand, interesting and which provide a good coverage of the dataset.</objective>

		<howWork>The genetic learning is performed iteratively until a maximum number of evaluations is reached. 
First, the algorithm generates an initial population with a good coverage of the dataset.
Then an offspring population is generated from the current population by selection, crossover and mutation.
The punishment mechanism is applied to each new individual, penalizing the ﬁtness value of an individual if it belongs to a niche of the solutions of the EP and is not better than the corresponding solution of the EP according to the ﬁtness function. 
The next population is constructed from the current and offspring populations, and, if necessary, the EP is updated based on the niches from the current population and the restarting process is applied. 
At the end, the EP is returned.
